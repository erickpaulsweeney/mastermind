# Mastermind
Mastermind is a code-breaking game where the aim is to guess a randonm 4-digit code where each code digit is in the range 1-5. 

For each guess the user is told: 
* How many digits in the guess are correct in both value and position. 
* How many digits in the guess have the correct value but are in the wrong position

The player loses if the player cannot guess the code within 10 attempts.
